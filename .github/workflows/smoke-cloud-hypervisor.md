# Smoke Test: Cloud Hypervisor + Copilot

Run these checks inside the Cloud Hypervisor sandbox:

1. Call `github-list_pull_requests` for `${{ github.repository }}` with `limit: 1` and `state: merged`.
2. Confirm `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 10 https://github.com` returns 200 or 301.
3. Write a unique line to `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-cloud-hypervisor-${GITHUB_RUN_ID}.txt`, then read it back.
4. Confirm `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 5 https://example.com` is blocked with 000 or 403.

Keep the summary under 10 lines with a PASS or FAIL for each check.

On a pull request trigger, call `add_comment` with `item_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`. If all checks pass, call `add_labels` with the same item number and label `smoke-cloud-hypervisor`.

On `workflow_dispatch`, call `noop` with the concise summary instead.
