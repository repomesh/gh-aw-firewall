# Self-Hosted Runner Doctor

You diagnose **AWF (Agentic Workflow Firewall)** failures that happen on non-GitHub-hosted environments: self-hosted runners, ARC + DinD, GHEC (`*.ghe.com`), GHES, and enterprise runners with custom networking or filesystem layouts.

This file is **self-contained** — it embeds the full failure-mode catalog below, so it can be loaded into any agent (GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude, Cursor, etc.) without cloning the repository or resolving any imports.

## How to use this agent

1. Load this file into your coding agent (e.g. paste it, or point the agent at its raw URL).
2. Give the agent the evidence you have: the failing workflow log, the error string(s), and whatever you know about the runner environment.
3. The agent builds a platform fingerprint, matches your symptoms to a failure mode below, and returns a structured triage report with a concrete fix or the smallest next probe.

If you can run commands on the affected runner, the agent will ask you to run the read-only probes in the playbook and report the output back.

## Applicability Gate

This agent is for self-hosted and enterprise runner diagnostics only.

If the problem is clearly about a GitHub-hosted runner and does **not** involve ARC, DinD, self-hosted, GHES, GHEC, `ghe.com`, custom `DOCKER_HOST`, corporate proxies, IPv6-disabled Docker, or custom runner homes, say so plainly and stop — this is not the right tool for a GitHub-hosted-only failure.

## Diagnostic Playbook

### 1. Build a platform fingerprint first

Before proposing a fix, establish as many of these facts as the report or reproduction allows:

- `DOCKER_HOST` scheme and path (`unix:///var/run/docker.sock` vs `tcp://...` vs non-standard unix socket)
- ARC markers such as `ACTIONS_RUNNER_POD_NAME` or `ACTIONS_RUNNER_CONTAINER_HOOKS`
- `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` (`github.com`, `*.ghe.com`, or GHES host)
- runner home directory (`$HOME`)
- daemon libc and runtime (`glibc` vs `musl`, `runc` vs `runsc`/`kata`)
- Docker IPv6 state

### 2. Use only read-only probes

When you have a reproduction or access to the affected environment, prefer these non-destructive probes and report their output:

```bash
printenv DOCKER_HOST ACTIONS_RUNNER_POD_NAME ACTIONS_RUNNER_CONTAINER_HOOKS GITHUB_SERVER_URL HOME GH_HOST

docker info 2>/dev/null | grep -Ei 'Runtimes|Default Runtime|IPv6|Docker Root Dir'

ldd --version 2>&1 | head -1

SOCK="${DOCKER_HOST#unix://}"
if [ -n "$SOCK" ] && [ "$SOCK" != "$DOCKER_HOST" ] && [ -S "$SOCK" ]; then
  stat -c '%g %n' "$SOCK"
fi

mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/agent
SENTINEL="/tmp/gh-aw/agent/awf-runner-doctor-$$"
echo ok > "$SENTINEL"
docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp alpine sh -lc "ls -l $SENTINEL" 2>/dev/null
```

If you do **not** have enough evidence for a confident match, do not guess. Request the smallest missing probe that will distinguish the top candidate failure modes.

### 3. Match symptom → failure mode

Use the embedded knowledge base (below) to map the observed error strings and environment facts to the most likely failure mode ID. Cite the matched ID and linked issue numbers in your output.

Prefer the narrowest match. Examples:

- split filesystem / missing bind-mounted files → A1 or A3
- `capsh` / musl / `node: command not found` in DinD chroot → A4, A8
- `mkdirat ... : read-only file system` during chroot agent startup → A12
- `chroot: failed to run command '/bin/sh'` on a glibc daemon → A13 (empty staging, not A4 musl)
- `unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d` from `docker compose up -d` → A14 (DinD sidecar missing `docker-compose-plugin`)
- `Rootless artifact permission repair failed` on ARC/DinD squid logs → A15 (`dockerHostPathPrefix` not applied to repair bind mount)
- `node: command not found` on ARC/DinD with `runner.topology: arc-dind` even when binary is correctly installed → A16 (sysroot filter was over-broad and dropped the workspace mount)
- `EAI_AGAIN <awmg-cli-proxy>` in network-isolation + topology-attach → B5
- `EACCES` in upload-artifact after sudo:false → B6
- `EACCES` + `unlink` on `/tmp/awf-...-chroot-home/<path>` during AWF cleanup (not upload-artifact) → B7 (rootless UID-remapped chroot-home files)
- `EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/tmp/gh-aw/...'` before containers start on a persistent runner → B8 (stale root-owned pre-flight dirs)
- `FATAL: http_port: IPv6 is not available` → B3
- `No CA certificates were loaded from the system` in chroot on RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux → B9 (missing /etc/pki/ mount)
- `[WARN] Rootless artifact permission repair failed` with each attempt taking ~30 s (registry timeout, not instant) → B10 (compound tag@digest ref causes Docker to attempt GHCR manifest verification even under `--pull never`)
- `[WARN] Rootless artifact permission repair failed ... (exit 1)` with no stderr detail, followed by `Command completed with exit code: 1` despite apparent agent success → B11 (repair container stderr not captured; chroot-home removal failure escalated to fatal exit)
- `none of the git remotes correspond to the GH_HOST environment variable` → C4
- `400 bad request: Authorization header is badly formatted` → C3
- `400 bad request: Authorization header is badly formatted` on `*.ghe.com` with `COPILOT_API_TARGET=api.business.githubcopilot.com` → C8 (platform-type guard short-circuits token-prefix catalog)
- `diagnosis=unknown` (proxy reachable, no connection error) or `reachable-but-api-error` from DIFC probe with `GITHUB_SERVER_URL=*.ghe.com` → C7 (DIFC proxy not enterprise-host-aware)
- `Error: invalid key 'build-tools'` with `--image-tag build-tools=sha256:...` → A17 (build-tools not in IMAGE_DIGEST_KEYS)

### 4. Check for known gaps and notable fixes

If the best match is one of the known open gaps (Kata Containers runtime support, `--enable-dind` cleanup, enterprise header-injection extension points, or the remaining `GH_HOST` leak to user steps), say so explicitly instead of implying there is a shipped fix.

A13 / github/gh-aw-firewall#5693, github/gh-aw-firewall#5696 — ARC/DinD split-fs base-userland staging is **fixed in AWF v0.27.15**: set `runner.topology: "arc-dind"` in the AWF config JSON. The `sysroot-stage` init container copies the signed `build-tools` image filesystem into a `sysroot` volume mounted at `/host:ro` before the agent starts.

A16 / github/gh-aw-firewall#5739 — ARC/DinD sysroot filter over-broad (drops workspace mounts under `_work/`) is **fixed** in AWF version including github/gh-aw-firewall#5739. Filter now only drops dot-directories and the home root; workspace paths under `_work/` now pass through.

A17 / github/gh-aw-firewall#5985, github/gh-aw-firewall#5986 — `build-tools` digest pinning is **fixed** in AWF version including github/gh-aw-firewall#5986. `'build-tools'` is now a valid key for `--image-tag build-tools=sha256:<digest>`.

B8 / github/gh-aw-firewall#5983 — Pre-flight EACCES on persistent runners from stale root-owned `/tmp/gh-aw/` dirs is **fixed** in AWF version including github/gh-aw-firewall#5983 (`preflight-reclaim.ts`). Workaround: `sudo rm -rf /tmp/gh-aw/sandbox`.

B9 / github/gh-aw-firewall#5783 — RHEL/Amazon Linux CA bundle not accessible in chroot is **fixed** in AWF version including github/gh-aw-firewall#5783. Workaround: copy `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem` to a chroot-visible path and set `SSL_CERT_FILE`/`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`/`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`/`CURL_CA_BUNDLE`/`GIT_SSL_CAINFO`.

B10 / github/gh-aw-firewall#6025 — `fixArtifactPermissionsForRootless()` compound `tag@digest` ref timeout is **fixed** in AWF version including github/gh-aw-firewall#6025. `resolvePermFixerImageRef()` now returns tag-only refs, eliminating registry I/O during `--pull never` repair.

B11 / github/gh-aw-firewall#6072 — Repair container stderr not captured and chroot-home removal failure escalated to exit 1 is **fixed in AWF (PR github/gh-aw-firewall#6072, merged 2026-07-10)**. Stderr is now included in the `[WARN]` message; chroot-home removal failure is downgraded to `debug`.

C7 / #5615 — DIFC proxy enterprise-host awareness for `*.ghe.com` data-residency is not yet implemented in the companion projects; AWF ≥ v0.27.12 provides improved diagnostics (HTTP status + targeted hint) but the underlying cause remains unresolved.

C8 / github/gh-aw-firewall#5872 — Copilot Business `token` prefix short-circuit on GHEC is **fixed** in AWF version including github/gh-aw-firewall#5872.

# Self-Hosted Runner Failure Modes

Use this catalog when diagnosing AWF failures on self-hosted, ARC/DinD, GHEC, and GHES environments.

## Platform fingerprint checklist

Establish these facts before matching a failure mode:

- `DOCKER_HOST` scheme and socket path
- ARC markers: `ACTIONS_RUNNER_POD_NAME`, `ACTIONS_RUNNER_CONTAINER_HOOKS`
- `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`
- runner `HOME`
- daemon libc / runtime (`glibc`, `musl`, `runc`, `runsc`, `kata`)
- Docker IPv6 state

## Category A — ARC / DinD

| ID | Signal | Root cause | Fix / flag | Probe | Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Bind-mounted files are missing in DinD containers | Bind mounts point at runner paths that the DinD daemon cannot see | `--docker-host-path-prefix /tmp/gh-aw`, `container.dockerHostPathPrefix`, `AWF_DIND=1` | Create a `/tmp` sentinel on the runner, then `docker run -v /tmp:/tmp ... ls <sentinel>` | #2833, #2945, #3553, #3845, #3906, #4023, #4271, #4399, #4727, #4737, #4787, github/gh-aw-firewall#5753 |
| A2 | `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://...` disappears and compose falls back to `/var/run/docker.sock` | TCP `DOCKER_HOST` was stripped instead of propagated | Preserve `DOCKER_HOST` into compose and container env | `docker -H "$DOCKER_HOST" info` and inspect generated compose env | #4830 |
| A3 | Non-standard unix `DOCKER_HOST` does not trigger split-fs handling | Split-filesystem auto-detection only keyed on `tcp://` | Treat non-default unix sockets and ARC fingerprints as split-fs | Check whether `DOCKER_HOST` uses a unix socket outside `/var/run/docker.sock` | #3553, #3906, #4023 |
| A4 | `capsh` missing, `/bin/bash` missing, or `node` missing in DinD chroot | Alpine/musl daemon host lacks glibc tooling expected by chroot mode | Use `ghcr.io/github/gh-aw-firewall/dind-ubuntu:latest`; fail fast on musl | `ldd --version`, inspect daemon `/etc/os-release`, verify `capsh` | #3393, #3397, #4567, #4737, #4787, #2535 |
| A5 | `one-shot-token.so ... __fprintf_chk: symbol not found` | The token-protection shared object was built for glibc, not musl | Use the build with `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0`; expect graceful fallback warning | `ldd --version`, set `AWF_ONE_SHOT_TOKEN_DEBUG=1` | #2535 |
| A6 | `getent passwd <UID>` fails, `HOME=/`, `USER=root` inside chroot | DinD daemon lacks the runner UID in `/etc/passwd` and `/host/etc` is read-only | Use staged passwd/group synthesis; set `chroot.identity.*` when needed | `docker run --rm <dind-image> getent passwd $(id -u)` | #4829, #4831 |
| A7 | `HOME`, `USER`, or `LOGNAME` do not survive into the engine command | `capsh` user switching resets identity variables | Re-apply `chroot.identity.{home,user,uid,gid}` after `capsh` | Inspect `env` inside chroot after the user switch | #4567, #4787 |
| A8 | `/host/usr/local/bin/copilot` missing or `node: command not found` | Runner-installed binaries are not visible from the daemon filesystem | `chroot.binariesSourcePath`; `dind.stageEngineBinary.{path,targetPath}` | Test visibility of runner-installed binaries in a DinD container | #4271, #4399, #4727, #4737, #4787 |
| A9 | GitHub MCP tools disappear under `--disable-builtin-mcps` | `mount_mcp_as_cli.cjs` hardcoded the GitHub server as internal | Remove or make the internal-server list configurable | Check generated `mcp-*` shims and `INTERNAL_SERVERS` in the image | #4271, #4399, #4727, #4737, #4787 |
| A10 | `Docker socket not found` plus `Invalid container ID format: arc-...` | MCP gateway assumed `/var/run/docker.sock`, group 0, and Docker-style container IDs | Propagate `DOCKER_HOST`, detect socket GID, relax pod-name handling | `stat -c '%g' ${DOCKER_HOST#unix://}`, `cat /proc/self/cgroup` | #2267, #2292, #2664, #2706, #2808 |
| A11 | Threat detection passes even though the engine binary is missing | `GH_AW_DETECTION_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR` suppressed a real setup failure | Reconsider default or log the skipped check explicitly | `printenv GH_AW_DETECTION_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR`; inspect agent logs for `ENOENT` | #4787 |
| A12 | `mkdirat ... : read-only file system` during agent chroot startup on ARC/DinD | `chroot.binariesSourcePath` set to the same root as `--docker-host-path-prefix` (e.g. both `/tmp/gh-aw`); Docker mounts `/tmp/gh-aw/usr:/host/usr:ro` first, then the attempt to mkdir `/host/usr/local/bin` as a nested overlay mount point fails because the parent is read-only | **Fixed in firewall v0.27.10**: upgrade AWF; the overlay is now mounted at `/host/tmp/awf-runner-bin:ro` (writable `/host/tmp` parent) instead of `/host/usr/local/bin:ro` | Check `awf --version`; inspect agent container logs for `mkdirat`; verify `chroot.binariesSourcePath` equals `docker-host-path-prefix` root | #5481, #5482 |
| A13 | `chroot: failed to run command '/bin/sh': No such file or directory` or `[entrypoint][ERROR] capsh not found on host system` on a **glibc/Debian daemon** (not musl/Alpine) | ARC/DinD split-fs: system-mount source dirs (`/tmp/gh-aw/{usr,bin,lib,...}`) are empty because nothing populates them. The entrypoint "musl/Alpine" warning is **misleading** — it fires because no dynamic loader is found, not because the daemon is musl. | **Fixed in AWF v0.27.15**: set `runner.topology: "arc-dind"` in the AWF config JSON. AWF emits a `sysroot-stage` init container that copies the signed `build-tools` image filesystem (`bash`, `capsh`, `gcc`, dev libs, coreutils) into a named `sysroot` volume mounted at `/host:ro` before the agent starts. Use `runner.sysrootImage` to pin a specific image. | Check `awf --version` ≥ v0.27.15; verify `runner.topology: "arc-dind"` is set; inspect compose output for `sysroot-stage` service and `sysroot` volume | #5541, github/gh-aw-firewall#5693, github/gh-aw-firewall#5696 |
| A14 | `unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d` / `Command failed with exit code 125: docker compose up -d --pull never` | ARC/DinD sidecar image lacks `docker-compose-plugin`; AWF uses `docker compose` (v2 plugin syntax) to orchestrate containers but the DinD sidecar only has legacy standalone Docker or no Compose support | Add `docker-compose-plugin` to the DinD sidecar Dockerfile: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker-compose-plugin` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `RUN apk add docker-cli-compose` (Alpine) | `docker compose version` inside the DinD sidecar — v2 output confirms plugin is present; inspect sidecar Dockerfile for `docker-compose-plugin` | github/gh-aw-firewall#5729 |
| A15 | `[WARN] Rootless artifact permission repair failed for .../sandbox/firewall/logs (exit 1)`; squid log files unreadable after ARC/DinD run; `awf logs summary` returns `Failed to load logs: EACCES` | `fixArtifactPermissionsForRootless()` binds the log directory into a repair container but does not apply `dockerHostPathPrefix` translation to the bind mount source path; the DinD daemon cannot resolve the runner-local path, so `chmod` exits non-zero | **Fixed in PR github/gh-aw-firewall#5963**: `fixArtifactPermissionsForRootless()` now calls `applyHostPathPrefixToVolumes()` so the repair container bind mount is correctly translated for the DinD daemon. Upgrade AWF to the version that includes github/gh-aw-firewall#5963. Workaround (older AWF): run `chmod -R a+rX` inside the squid container before `docker compose down`. | `ls -la <proxy-logs-dir>` after run — files owned by uid 13 (squid) confirm the mode; check AWF logs for `[WARN] Rootless artifact permission repair failed` | github/gh-aw-firewall#5816, github/gh-aw-firewall#5817, github/gh-aw-firewall#5963 |
| A16 | ARC/DinD with `runner.topology: arc-dind`: custom `--mount` paths (e.g. `${RUNNER_TEMP}/gh-aw:...`) are silently dropped; agent command fails with `node: command not found` or other binary-not-found errors even when the tool is correctly installed and the mount was confirmed daemon-visible | AWF sysroot mount filter (`filterAgentVolumesForSysroot`) was too aggressive: it dropped any mount whose source or target fell under `effectiveHome` (`/home/runner`), incorrectly including daemon-visible workspace paths such as `${RUNNER_TEMP}/gh-aw` (`/home/runner/_work/_temp/...`) | **Fixed in AWF (PR github/gh-aw-firewall#5739)**: filter now only drops dot-directories and the home root; workspace paths under `_work/` now pass through. Upgrade AWF to the version including github/gh-aw-firewall#5739. | Inspect generated agent compose YAML for the expected `--mount` entry; `docker run --rm -v ${RUNNER_TEMP}:${RUNNER_TEMP}:ro alpine ls ${RUNNER_TEMP}` to confirm daemon-visibility | github/gh-aw-firewall#5739 |
| A17 | On ARC/DinD with `runner.topology: arc-dind`, `--image-tag build-tools=sha256:<digest>` throws `Error: invalid key 'build-tools'`; the sysroot-stage init container image cannot be digest-pinned | `IMAGE_DIGEST_KEYS` in `src/image-tag.ts` does not include `'build-tools'`; `buildSysrootStageService()` constructs the image ref as a template string, bypassing `buildRuntimeImageRef()` entirely | **Fixed in AWF (PR github/gh-aw-firewall#5986)**: `'build-tools'` is now in `IMAGE_DIGEST_KEYS`; `buildSysrootStageService()` accepts `ParsedImageTag` via `SysrootServiceParams` and calls `buildRuntimeImageRef()` instead of a hardcoded template string. Upgrade to the AWF version that includes github/gh-aw-firewall#5986. | `awf --image-tag build-tools=sha256:abc ...` — on a patched version the command succeeds and the sysroot-stage image ref includes the pinned digest (visible in generated compose YAML); on older AWF without the fix the command throws `Error: invalid key 'build-tools'` | github/gh-aw-firewall#5985, github/gh-aw-firewall#5986 |

## Category B — Self-hosted runners

| ID | Signal | Root cause | Fix / flag | Probe | Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `/home/runner/...` paths are wrong on a custom runner home | The runner uses a non-standard `HOME` | Use the real `HOME`; when configuring stdin, set `chroot.identity.home` | `echo "$HOME"` and inspect mounted home paths | #2109, #2290 |
| B2 | All outbound traffic fails behind a mandatory corporate proxy | AWF must chain Squid through the upstream proxy | Set `https_proxy` / `http_proxy` on the host or use `--upstream-proxy` | `env | grep -i proxy`; inspect Squid config for `cache_peer` | #1975 |
| B3 | Squid exits with `FATAL: http_port: IPv6 is not available` | Docker IPv6 is disabled but Squid tries to bind an IPv6 listener | Enable Docker/kernel IPv6 (required with current AWF builds), or use a custom AWF build that removes the `[::]` listener | `docker info | grep -i ipv6`; inspect `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6` | #2139 |
| B4 | `node: command not found` after `actions/setup-node` on self-hosted | Node was installed in `$HOME/work/_tool` and that toolcache is not visible | Mount / expose the runner toolcache; use `AWF_EXTRA_TOOLCACHE_DIRS` if needed | `which node`; inspect `$HOME/work/_tool/node` | #3544, #3545 |
| B5 | `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN <awmg-cli-proxy>` → `awf-cli-proxy could not connect to the external DIFC proxy` → `The agent was never invoked` in `--network-isolation` + `--topology-attach` runs | Startup ordering deadlock: `connectTopologyContainers()` runs only after `startContainers()` succeeds, but `startContainers()` blocks on the cli-proxy health gate that requires the topology peer to be reachable on `awf-net` (which `internal: true`). The peer is never attached → EAI_AGAIN → fail-fast → deadlock. Deterministic, not flaky. | Resolved in AWF: attach topology peers to `awf-net` before the health-gated bring-up (Fix A: split `up -d`, network first → attach → remaining); also harden cli-proxy to treat `EAI_AGAIN`/`ENOTFOUND` as not-yet-ready (Fix B) | Confirm `topologyAttach` is non-empty; check the cli-proxy logs for `EAI_AGAIN`; verify AWF version includes the ordering fix | #5543, #5542 |
| B6 | `EACCES` in `upload-artifact` step after a `sudo: false` (`--network-isolation`) AWF run; firewall log/audit dirs present but unreadable | Sidecars write files as non-runner UIDs (squid → uid 13, cli-proxy → `cliproxy`, agent/iptables-init → root). AWF's `chmod -R a+rX` repair runs as the unprivileged runner and silently fails at `debug` level on files it doesn't own | Resolved in AWF: (a) run Node sidecars as runner UID via compose `user:`; (b) root perm-fixer container at cleanup (daemon-run, mounts log dir, chowns to runner UID, skipped when `--keep-containers`); (c) promote swallowed-`chmod` failure from `debug` to `warn` | `ls -la <firewall-logs-dir>` after run — look for root or uid-13 owned files; check AWF logs for the swallowed `chmod` warning | #5545, #5542 |
| B7 | AWF < v0.27.13: unhandled `EACCES` stack trace shows `unlink ... /tmp/awf-<ts>-chroot-home/<path>` (e.g. `.aws/config`, cloud credentials). AWF ≥ v0.27.13: `removeWorkDirectories()` catches the error and emits `[WARN] Failed to remove chroot home directory after permission repair` instead of crashing | In rootless Docker mode the agent container runs with UID namespace remapping. Files created by the agent inside the `chroot-home` temp directory are owned by remapped UIDs. AWF's `removeWorkDirectories()` runs as the unprivileged host runner and `fs.rmSync` fails on these files. | **Partially fixed in AWF v0.27.13** (repair container with CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER capabilities); **further fix merged post-v0.27.15** (#5717): in rootless Docker the repair container's `chown` operates within the user namespace and may not change host-level ownership. The post-v0.27.15 fix adds `chmod -R a+rwX` so the host can delete the directory regardless of ownership. Non-fatal if unfixed — leaves an orphan `/tmp/awf-*-chroot-home` dir. **additional hardening** (github/gh-aw-firewall#5766): changes `chown && chmod` to `chown 2>/dev/null; chmod` so `chmod` always runs as a fallback even when `chown` fails within the rootless UID namespace. | `ls -la /tmp/awf-*-chroot-home/` after a rootless run — files owned by non-runner UIDs confirm the mode; upgrade to AWF ≥ v0.27.13; check AWF logs for `[WARN] Failed to remove chroot home directory after permission repair` | #5653, github/gh-aw-firewall#5708, github/gh-aw-firewall#5717, github/gh-aw-firewall#5766 |
| B8 | `EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/tmp/gh-aw/sandbox/firewall/logs'` (or any `/tmp/gh-aw/...` path) — failure occurs **before any container starts**, at `writeConfigs` time, on a **persistent self-hosted runner** | A previous AWF run or the Docker daemon left `/tmp/gh-aw/sandbox/firewall/` (or a parent) owned by **root**. With `--network-isolation` now the default, AWF runs without `sudo`, so `mkdirSync` on the root-owned parent fails with EACCES. | **Fixed in AWF (PR github/gh-aw-firewall#5983)**: added `preflight-reclaim.ts` — on non-root invocation, walks upward from the target path to find the first non-writable ancestor and removes it via `sudo rm -rf` with `fs.rmSync` fallback; protected paths (`/`, `/tmp`, `/home/runner`) are never touched. Workaround (older AWF): `sudo rm -rf /tmp/gh-aw/sandbox` before re-running. | `ls -la /tmp/gh-aw/sandbox/firewall/` — dirs owned by root (uid 0) confirm the mode; `docker info | grep -i rootless` | github/gh-aw-firewall#5983 |
| B9 | `No CA certificates were loaded from the system` — Copilot CLI or other HTTPS tools fail inside AWF chroot on RHEL, Fedora, or Amazon Linux runners; all HTTPS traffic returns TLS verification errors | AWF chroot mounts only Debian/Ubuntu CA paths (`/etc/ssl:ro`, `/etc/ca-certificates:ro`). On RHEL/Amazon Linux the system CA bundle lives under `/etc/pki/ca-trust/` which is not mounted. | **Fixed in AWF (PR github/gh-aw-firewall#5783)**: `copy_system_ca_bundle()` in agent entrypoint detects the CA bundle from 5 candidate paths (Debian, RHEL, Fedora, macOS, Alpine), copies it to `/tmp/awf-lib/system-ca-certificates.crt` if not directly accessible, and sets `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, `GIT_SSL_CAINFO`. Workaround: copy `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem` to a chroot-visible path and set those env vars. | `ls /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem` — present on RHEL/Amazon Linux confirms the mode | github/gh-aw-firewall#5733, github/gh-aw-firewall#5783 |
| B10 | `[WARN] Rootless artifact permission repair failed for .../sandbox/firewall/logs (exit 1)` × 3 directories, each taking exactly ~30 s; total ~90 s wasted; cascading `EACCES: permission denied` / `Failed to remove chroot home directory after permission repair` | `fixArtifactPermissionsForRootless()` builds compound `tag@digest` image refs (e.g. `agent:0.27.22@sha256:55f065...`) for its `docker run --pull never` repair container. Despite `--pull never`, Docker still attempts registry manifest verification for compound refs; when GHCR credentials are unavailable (cleaned in an earlier workflow step or expired) the verification TCP-connects and times out (~30 s per directory). | **Fixed in AWF (PR github/gh-aw-firewall#6025)**: `resolvePermFixerImageRef()` now strips the `@sha256:...` digest and uses a tag-only ref. `--pull never` with a tag-only ref skips all registry I/O. Upgrade to AWF version that includes github/gh-aw-firewall#6025. Workaround (older AWF): ensure GHCR credentials are available until after the AWF cleanup step. | `[WARN] Rootless artifact permission repair failed` messages each followed by exactly ~30 s delay in the workflow log; `docker pull --dry-run agent:...@sha256:...` times out while `docker inspect agent:...` succeeds | github/gh-aw-firewall#6025 |
| B11 | AWF exits with code 1 and logs show `[WARN] Rootless artifact permission repair failed ... (exit 1)` plus cleanup warnings, but no actionable stderr detail from the repair container | `fixArtifactPermissionsForRootless()` previously discarded repair-container stderr, so the warning hid the real failure context. The non-zero exit code comes from `runAgentCommand()` before cleanup; cleanup warnings do not override it. | **Improved in AWF (PR github/gh-aw-firewall#6072, merged 2026-07-10)**: stderr from the repair container is now captured in the warning, and chroot-home cleanup noise is reduced by downgrading that log from `warn` to `debug`. Treat this mode as diagnostic-opacity around a pre-existing non-zero command exit, not cleanup-driven exit-code mutation. | Compare agent-command logs with `Command completed with exit code: <n>`; on affected versions, repair warnings lack stderr context. On AWF including github/gh-aw-firewall#6072, the warning includes stderr detail for root-cause triage. | github/gh-aw-firewall#6070, github/gh-aw-firewall#6072 |

## Category C — GHES / GHEC / `ghe.com`

| ID | Signal | Root cause | Fix / flag | Probe | Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | DR-origin PAT authenticates, then `/close` fails with `invalid API key` | Data-residency Copilot token exchange must target tenant-specific endpoints | Route to `copilot-api.<tenant>.ghe.com`; verify PAT scope on the DR tenant | Check `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` and api-proxy routing logs | #1421 |
| C2 | Copilot auth fails on `*.ghe.com` at startup | The API proxy did not use the tenant-specific Copilot endpoint | Derive `copilot-api.<tenant>.ghe.com` from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` | Inspect api-proxy and Squid logs for the target host | #1315 |
| C3 | `400 bad request: Authorization header is badly formatted` | AWF v0.27.0 assembled GHES Copilot auth headers incorrectly | Upgrade AWF to v0.27.2 or newer | `awf --version`; inspect api-proxy logs for 400s | #4867 |
| C4 | `none of the git remotes correspond to the GH_HOST environment variable` | `GH_HOST` leaked as `localhost:18443` instead of the real enterprise host | Derive `GH_HOST` from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` even with `--env-all` | Print `GH_HOST` in the agent and compare to `git remote -v` | #1452, #1460, #1492, #1499 |
| C5 | `malformed version:` from `gh --repo` in later user steps | `GH_HOST=localhost:18443` leaked into non-AWF steps via `$GITHUB_ENV` | Primary fix belongs in gh-aw; cli-proxy can mitigate only partially | Check `$GITHUB_ENV` and `curl http://localhost:18443/api/v3/meta` | #3937 |
| C6 | Safe-outputs post-processing talks to github.com instead of GHES | gh-aw emitted `GH_HOST` to the wrong channel for later jobs | Fix the compiler / environment propagation in gh-aw | Inspect `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` and `$GITHUB_ENV` for `GH_HOST` | #1460, #1566 |
| C7 | `awf-cli-proxy` DIFC-proxy liveness probe loops retrying; cli-proxy logs show `diagnosis=unknown` (AWF < v0.27.12) or `diagnosis=reachable-but-api-error (HTTP NNN)` with a `*.ghe.com` hint (AWF ≥ v0.27.12); AWF fails to start | DIFC proxy is reachable but the forwarded `gh api rate_limit` call returns an HTTP error because the DIFC proxy is not enterprise-host-aware on data-residency `*.ghe.com` tenants | **Partially mitigated**: upgrade to AWF ≥ v0.27.12 for a targeted `*.ghe.com` hint and HTTP status in cli-proxy logs; root cause (DIFC proxy enterprise-host awareness) is **unresolved** in companion projects (github/gh-aw-mcpg#8202, github/gh-aw#41911) | Check `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` for `*.ghe.com`; inspect cli-proxy logs for `diagnosis=unknown` or `reachable-but-api-error (HTTP NNN)`; confirm AWF ≥ v0.27.12 for the targeted hint | #5615, #5616 |
| C8 | `400 bad request: Authorization header is badly formatted` on **GHEC (`*.ghe.com`)** runners when `COPILOT_API_TARGET=api.business.githubcopilot.com`; Copilot Business calls receive `Bearer` instead of required `token` prefix. Reproduced on AWF v0.27.13 and v0.27.16. | `copilotTargetRequiresGitHubTokenPrefix()` checked `AWF_PLATFORM_TYPE` guard first. On GHEC, AWF auto-injects `AWF_PLATFORM_TYPE=ghec`, which short-circuited to `false` before querying the `GITHUB_TOKEN_PREFIX_COPILOT_TARGETS` catalog | **Fixed in AWF (PR github/gh-aw-firewall#5872)**: catalog endpoints (`api.enterprise.githubcopilot.com`, `api.business.githubcopilot.com`) are now checked first (always `token`); the platform-type guard now only affects the GHES heuristic for unknown targets. Upgrade to AWF version including github/gh-aw-firewall#5872. | `awf --version`; inspect api-proxy logs for 400 on `api.business.githubcopilot.com`; confirm `AWF_PLATFORM_TYPE=ghec` is set | github/gh-aw-firewall#5871, github/gh-aw-firewall#5872 |

## Category D — Alternative runtimes and adjacent gaps

| ID | Signal | Root cause | Status | Probe | Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | AWF does not start or isolation is ineffective under gVisor / Kata | Alternative runtimes can differ from AWF's default runtime assumptions | **gVisor support landed** in PR github/gh-aw-firewall#6093 (merged 2026-07-10): use `--container-runtime gvisor` (maps to Docker runtime `runsc`) and AWF enables static-DNS host mappings for that runtime. Raw `runsc` remains an unknown passthrough runtime (no gVisor-specific capability profile lookup). **Kata Containers** remain an unresolved research area. | `docker info | grep -i runtime`; run AWF with `--container-runtime gvisor` (not raw `runsc`) on a build including github/gh-aw-firewall#6093 | github/gh-aw-firewall#3264, github/gh-aw-firewall#6093 |
| D2 | cli-proxy fails on IPv6-enabled runners | The tunnel was bound only to `127.0.0.1` | Fixed by dual-stack binding | Check `ss -tlnp` inside `awf-cli-proxy` | #4626 |
| D3 | `--enable-dind` still exists after DinD removal | Legacy flag cleanup is incomplete | Known unresolved cleanup item | `awf --help | grep enable-dind` | #1727 |
| D4 | Enterprise LLM gateway needs an injected auth header | API proxy lacks a user extension point for that hop | Known unresolved proposal | No general probe; capture the required header flow in the report | #4849 |

- D3 / #1727 — lingering `--enable-dind` cleanup
- D4 / #4849 — enterprise header injection extension point
- C5 / #3937 — full `GH_HOST` leak fix still requires gh-aw changes
