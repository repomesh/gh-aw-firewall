/**
 * Docker-in-Docker Removal Regression Tests
 * Tests for PR #205: https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall/pull/205
 *
 * These tests verify that Docker commands fail gracefully after Docker-in-Docker
 * support was removed in v0.9.1. The agent container should NOT have:
 * - docker-cli installed
 * - Docker socket mounted
 * - Docker daemon running
 *
 * IMPORTANT: These tests require container images built from commit 8d81fe4 or later.
 * If using registry images (ghcr.io/github/gh-aw-firewall), ensure they have been
 * rebuilt after PR #205 was merged. Otherwise, use `buildLocal: true` in test options
 * to build fresh images from the current codebase.
 *
 * Known Issue: Building locally may fail due to NodeSource repository issues.
 * If tests fail with "docker found" errors, the images need to be rebuilt and published.
 *
 * NOTE: docker-warning.test.ts was removed as redundant — the Docker stub-script
 * approach was superseded by removing docker-cli entirely. This file covers the
 * Docker removal behavior (command not found, no socket, graceful failure).
