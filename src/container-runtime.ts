/**
 * Container runtime resolution and capability detection.
 *
 * Centralises three concerns:
 *
 * 1. **Name translation** – user-facing runtime names (e.g. `"gvisor"`) are
 *    mapped to Docker OCI runtime identifiers (e.g. `"runsc"`).  Unknown names
 *    are passed through unchanged so callers can also use raw Docker names.
 *
 * 2. **Capability flags** – each runtime can declare behavioural quirks that
 *    AWF must compensate for.  Current flags:
 *    - `needsStaticDns` – runtime cannot reach Docker's embedded DNS at
 *      127.0.0.11, so AWF must inject `/etc/hosts` entries for every service.
 *
 * 3. **Execution model** – describes how the agent is launched:
 *    - `compose` – agent is a Docker Compose service alongside Squid/api-proxy
 *      (default; used by runc and gVisor).  The agent container may use a
 *      non-default OCI runtime but is still orchestrated by `docker compose`.
 *    - `microvm` – agent runs in a hypervisor-isolated microVM (e.g. Docker
 *      sbx).  Infrastructure services (Squid, api-proxy) stay in Docker Compose
 *      on the host; only the agent crosses the hypervisor boundary.  The sbx
 *      proxy chains upstream through AWF's host-side Squid for domain filtering,
 *      and through the api-proxy for token logging/model routing/credential
 *      injection.
 *
 * ## Adding a new OCI runtime
 *
 * Add an entry to {@link RUNTIME_REGISTRY} with `executionModel: 'compose'`,
 * the Docker runtime name, and capability flags.  All consumers (agent-service,
 * cli-workflow, topology) pick up the new runtime automatically via the
 * capability query functions.
 *
 * ## Adding a microVM backend (e.g. Docker sbx)
 *
 * Add an entry with `executionModel: 'microvm'`.  Callers use
 * {@link runtimeUsesComposeAgent} to decide whether to include the agent
 * service in docker-compose.yml and whether to use `docker logs/wait` or
 * the microVM CLI for agent lifecycle management.  Infrastructure services
 * (Squid, api-proxy) are generated regardless of execution model.
